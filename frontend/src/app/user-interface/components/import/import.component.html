  <h1>
    Notebook import
  </h1>

  <p>
    While <a routerLink="../../../servers">DoubleNote-servers</a> are a great
    choice for backing up your data, syncing it access devices and sharing it
    with the people you want to, they are not always the available, which is why
    DoubleNote offers the ability to manually export and import your notebooks.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can import notebooks from several of sources, such as your clipboard
    (using JSON) or using DoubleNote's built-in native migration tools.
  </p>
  <p>
    Transfering notebooks via JSON is less secure, but easier to use, and can be
    done across multiple devices and browsers, and even between multiple users.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sharing data using DoubleNote's native migration tools is safer and easier,
    especially when dealing with multiple notebooks from several sources, but
    doesn't work across devices for for several users.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Only import notebooks from sources you trust.</em>
  </p>

  <h2>
    Native import
  </h2>

  <p>
    DoubleNote supports migrating (importing and exporting) notebooks from one
    DoubleNote instance to another. This is accomplished by following these
    steps:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Open this page in the DoubleNote instance into which you want to import
    </li>
    <li>
      Copy the import-URL displayed below (you will need it soon)
    </li>
    <li>
      Open the DoubleNote instance from which you want to export a notebook
    </li>
    <li>
      On the notebook you want to export, click "export", then click "native
      export"
    </li>
    <li>
      Close this page and follow the remaining steps on the other instance.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    The import-URL of this instance is: <br />
    <code>{{ importUrl }}</code>
  </p>

  <h2>
    JSON paste
  </h2>

  <p>
    Exported notebooks can be imported using their JSON representation. <br />
    Use the button below to paste the JSON from your clipboard, then enter the
    desired name and hit import.
  </p>

  <p>
    <button mat-raised-button (click)="pasteJSON()" color="accent">
      Paste JSON
    </button>
    &nbsp;
    <button
      mat-stroked-button
      (click)="importNotebook()"
      color="accent"
      [disabled]="disableImport"
    >
      Import notebook
    </button>
  </p>

  <p *ngIf="pastedJSON === ''">
    Paste the JSON representation of your notebook using the button above.
    <br />
    A preview of the pasted JSON contents will appear here.
