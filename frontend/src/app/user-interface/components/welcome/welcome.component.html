  <h2>Notebook types</h2>
  <p>
    This software is supposed to be used for taking notes. There are two
    different types of notebooks, one called "Box canvas page" and the other
    called "Sequential block page".
  </p>

  <p>
    The type of notebook is determined by the user when its created and cannot
    be changed afterwards.
  </p>

  <h3>Box canvas page</h3>

  <p>
    The box canvas page (also referred to as BCP) model consists of pages which
    are not limitend in the way that they are layed out. Users may write down
    formatted text anywhere on the page by creating a box. The term "canvas"
    refers to the ability to create free-hand drawings on every such page.
  </p>

  <h3>Sequential block page</h3>

  <p>
    The sequential block page (also referred to as SBP) model is based on the
    idea that every page is divided into a linear sequence of blocks, which can
    be of different types, such as headings, text, picture or other kinds of
    embeds.

  <h2>Collaboration</h2>
