   * altered parameters: A part of the text is parsed, and the rest is sent
   * back into the parser. The line number is sent along as a way for the
   * parser to know which part of the input text correspond to a node in the
   * MDOM tree. This is useful when partial updates are required, as only the
   * affected markdown has to be replaced, and errors can be linted.
   *
   * @param text The (remaining) text to be parsed
   * @param lineNumber The number of the first line inputted from the text

      # Objectives

      - Producing markdown from one MDOM tree should always produce the same markdown
      - Only update the nodes in an existing tree which need to be updated
      - Mark where in the tree those nodes belong
        - A node might be
          - new
          - updated
          - removed

      # Strategy

      - Support parsing a markdown document from scratch
      - Support partial updates to existing trees

      ## Implementation

      - Check if line is empty
        - Increment line number
        - Cut off the empty line
        - Rerun the parser
      - Use several regexes on one line
