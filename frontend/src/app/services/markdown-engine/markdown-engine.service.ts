   * back into the parser. The line number is sent along as a way for the
   * parser to know which part of the input text correspond to a node in the
   * MDOM tree. This is useful when partial updates are required, as only the
   * affected markdown has to be replaced, and errors can be linted.

   * @param lineNumber The number of the first line inputted from the text

      # Objectives

      - Producing markdown from one MDOM tree should always produce the same markdown
      - Only update the nodes in an existing tree which need to be updated
      - Mark where in the text those nodes belong
        - A node might be
          - created
          - updated
          - removed

      # Strategy

      - Support parsing a markdown document from scratch
      - Support partial updates to existing trees

      ## Implementation

      - Divide the text into block elements
        - Keep track of the line numbers (start & end)
      - Parse inline elements within the block elements
